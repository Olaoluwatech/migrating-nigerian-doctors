# Migrating Nigerian Medical Doctors
Percentage of Nigerian Medical Graduates that left for the Uk alone in the last one year.

# Description
This work was inspired by the increase number of Nigerian doctors relocating to the United Kingdom and other developed countries. 
There was a news by Punch, that about 727 Nigeria medical doctors migrated to the UK between December 2021  and May 2022 (6 months period).
I decided to gather the data of the total number of medical doctors that are produced by each medical school in Nigeria from the 
Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) website, to detemine the percentage of Nigerian doctors that left for the UK alone in the last one year, assumming
about twice that number leave every year.
